    <h2>What's important to you?</h2>
    <p>My family and my two dogs. According to a recent piece by Mic in partnership with GE, “Not only do dogs seem to love us back, they actually see us as their family. It turns out that dogs rely on humans more than they do their own kind for affection,
      protection and everything in between.”</p>
